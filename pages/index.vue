        <p>
          I work on different kinds of projects and various tech stacks. Created
          projects, most of them are private for now. New projects are yet to
          come. I choose a simple yet aesthetic design, that's the reason for
          this design.

          Also planning to create a blog with this site. I will be updating this
          site. You can always say hello by using one of
          <nuxt-link to="contact">these</nuxt-link>
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from programming, I also enjoy listening to music, Spending time
          with Loved ones and my pets. I'm a person who seeks a bit of privacy,
          which is why I'm not sharing all my details here. You can contact me
          via my handles. Thank you for Spending time reading this, Have a nice
          day.
